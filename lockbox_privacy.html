<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
Last updated: 24th August 2024

<h3>Introduction</h3>
Welcome to Lockbox, an app designed to help you securely encrypt, decrypt, zip, and compress your files. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how Lockbox handles your information.

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
No User Data Collection:
Lockbox does not collect, store, or share any personal data from its users. The app operates entirely on your device and does not transmit any data to external servers or third parties.

<h3>How We Use Information</h3>
Since Lockbox does not collect any personal data, we do not use your information in any way.

<h3>File Encryption and Decryption</h3>
Lockbox provides tools for encrypting and decrypting your files. All encryption and decryption processes occur locally on your device. Lockbox does not access, store, or share your files. The files you choose to encrypt or decrypt remain entirely under your control.

<h3>File Sharing</h3>
User-initiated Sharing:
Lockbox allows you to share encrypted or decrypted files at your discretion. When you choose to share a file, the transfer is handled by the apps or services you select (e.g., email, messaging apps). Lockbox does not have access to, or control over, the files once they are shared.

<h3>Security</h3>
We take security seriously and have implemented measures to ensure that your files are handled securely within the app. However, the security of your files ultimately depends on how you manage your device and the files themselves.

<h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
